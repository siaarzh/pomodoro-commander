# Pomodoro Commander - Upgrade Roadmap

## Current Status (Node.js v16)

**Why we're stuck on Node.js v16:**
- `nedb` database library is incompatible with Node.js v17+
- `happypack` webpack plugin is deprecated and has compatibility issues
- OpenSSL changes in newer Node.js versions break some dependencies
- Several other legacy dependencies need updates

## Upgrade Plan (Node.js v24+)

### Phase 1: Dependency Analysis âœ…
- [x] Identify all problematic dependencies
- [x] Research modern alternatives
- [x] Create compatibility branch: `feature/nodejs-v24-compatibility`

### Phase 2: Core Dependencies (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Replace `nedb`** with modern alternative:
  - Options: `better-sqlite3`, `sqlite3`, `lowdb`, or `dexie`
  - Migration script for existing data
  - Update all database operations
  
- [ ] **Replace `happypack`** with `thread-loader`:
  - Update webpack configuration
  - Test build performance
  - Ensure all workers still function

### Phase 3: Node.js Compatibility (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Update to Node.js v18 LTS** (intermediate step):
  - Test all functionality
  - Fix any remaining compatibility issues
  - Update CI/CD pipelines

- [ ] **Update to Node.js v20 LTS**:
  - Full compatibility testing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Update documentation

- [ ] **Update to Node.js v24+**:
  - Latest features and performance improvements
  - Long-term support

### Phase 4: Modernization (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Update all dependencies** to latest versions:
  - `electron` to latest stable
  - `webpack` to v5+
  - `typescript` to latest
  - All other dependencies

- [ ] **Remove legacy workarounds**:
  - Clean up temporary Node.js switching scripts
  - Remove Windows-specific compatibility code
  - Simplify build process

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Comprehensive testing**:
  - Unit tests pass
  - Integration tests pass
  - Cross-platform builds work
  - Performance regression testing

- [ ] **User acceptance testing**:
  - Data migration works correctly
  - All features function as expected
  - No performance degradation

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Phase 2 (Core Dependencies)
- **Week 2**: Phase 3 (Node.js Compatibility)
- **Week 3**: Phase 4 (Modernization)
- **Week 4**: Phase 5 (Testing & Validation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Migration**: Create comprehensive backup and migration tools
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep Node.js v16 branch as fallback
- **Incremental Updates**: Test each major dependency change separately
- **CI/CD**: Ensure automated testing catches regressions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Application runs on Node.js v24+
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build process is simplified
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Data migration is seamless
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Notes

- Current workarounds (nvm switching, Windows scripts) are temporary
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility during transition
- Consider breaking changes only if absolutely necessary
- Prioritize user experience and data integrity
