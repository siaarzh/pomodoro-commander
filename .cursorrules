# Pomodoro Commander - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Context
This is a fork of PomodoroLogger, rebranded as "Pomodoro Commander" - a productivity app combining Pomodoro technique, time tracking, and Kanban boards.

## Repository & CI/CD
- **Platform**: GitHub (not GitLab)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Coverage**: Codecov integration
- **Note**: When user mentions "GitLab" or "GitLab CI", they mean GitHub/GitHub Actions (force of habit from working primarily with GitLab)

## Current Status
- ✅ Rebranding complete (PomodoroLogger → Pomodoro Commander)
- ✅ Node.js v16.13.2 compatibility setup
- ✅ Cross-platform build system configured
- ✅ CI/CD with Codecov integration
- ⚠️ Requires Node.js v16.13.2 (see .nvmrc)

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript throughout
- Follow existing code style (tslint + prettier)
- Use styled-components for styling
- Maintain Electron app structure (main + renderer processes)
- Test with Jest before committing

## Current TODOs
- [x] Set up Node.js v16.13.2 development environment
- [x] Test build process with correct Node.js version
- [x] Verify all features work after rebranding
- [x] Update any remaining hardcoded references
- [x] Test cross-platform builds (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- [x] Set up development workflow documentation

## Next Phase: Node.js v24+ Upgrade
- [ ] Follow UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md for modernization
- [ ] Update nedb to modern database library
- [ ] Replace happypack with thread-loader
- [ ] Fix OpenSSL compatibility issues
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest versions
- [ ] Remove temporary workarounds and Windows-specific scripts
